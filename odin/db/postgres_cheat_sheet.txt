       kill PATTERN...
           Send a signal to one or more processes of the unit. Use --kill-who=
           to select which process to kill. Use --signal= to select the signal
           to send.

       is-active PATTERN...
           Check whether any of the specified units are active (i.e. running).
           Returns an exit code 0 if at least one is active, or non-zero
           otherwise. Unless --quiet is specified, this will also print the
           current unit state to standard output.

       is-failed PATTERN...
           Check whether any of the specified units are in a "failed" state.
           Returns an exit code 0 if at least one has failed, non-zero
           otherwise. Unless --quiet is specified, this will also print the
           current unit state to standard output.
